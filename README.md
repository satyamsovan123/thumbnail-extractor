YouTube Thumbnail Extractor

It's a free YouTube video's thumbnail extractor. I just made it for fun, just cause I was bored and I got the pattern of YouTube's thumbnail.
It's the minified version. Use some beautification before reviewing the code. And it's live as well. https://youtubethumbnail.netlify.app/
For some reason, it's not working in Safari, please use anything other than Safari. I'm working on this issue.
